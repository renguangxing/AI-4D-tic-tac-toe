<h1>4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe Game </h1>

<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
Our goal is to create a AI system that implements minimax algorithm and heuristic evaluation for a 4x4x4 3D tic tac toe game. Our AI system should win every time against random move AI.
In order to improve the efficiency of our minimax algorithm, we should also add a Alpha beta pruning to our minimax function to decrease our calculation workload.
</p>
<hr>
<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>
Player 1 is the AI player and Player 2 is the Random-Moved player that we play against.<br>

</p>


<p>
The important files we’re working with include:<br>
<b>minimax function:</b>
The purpose of the minimax is to minimize maximum possible loss.The algorithm evaluates the leaf nodes (terminating “gameover” nodes or at maximum depth) using the heuristic evaluation function.Suppose that there are only one or two possible moves
per player in each turn. Further the evaluation function returns +9999<br>
In this programming assignment, we implement a minimax system as well as<br>
<img src = "Minimax.png">


<b>Psuedo-code is as below:</b><br>
function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer)<br>
    if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node then<br>
        return the heuristic value of node<br>
    if maximizingPlayer then<br>
        value := −∞<br>
        for each child of node do<br>
            value := max(value, minimax(child, depth − 1, FALSE))<br>
        return value<br>
    else (* minimizing player *)<br>
        value := +∞<br>
        for each child of node do<br>
            value := min(value, minimax(child, depth − 1, TRUE))<br>
        return value<br>


<b>heuristic evaluation function:</b>
We Create a EvaluateBoard() function to evaluate the heuristic value of the whole board. The positive result suggest that Player 1 have advantage while negative value suggest that player 2 have the advantage.<br>

<b>Pseudo-code is as below:</b><br>
EvaluateBoard(board){<br>
score=0;<br>
For each line L{<br>
score+=evaluateLine(L)<br>
}<br>
return Score<br>
}<br>

We also create a evaluateLine() to evaluate the heuristic value of a line.The criteria are
 pseudo-code<br>

 Positive Infinity<br>
+9999 for EACH 4-in-a-line for AI
+100 for EACH 3-in-a-line for AI.<br>
+10 for EACH two-in-a-line (with a empty cell) for AI.<br>
+1 for EACH one-in-a-line (with two empty cells) for AI.<br>
Negative scores for opponent, i.e.,-9999, -100, -10, -1 for EACH opponent's 4-in-a-line,3-in-a-line, 2-in-a-line and 1-in-a-line.
0 otherwise (empty lines or lines with both computer's and opponent's seeds)<br>

Pseudo-code<br>
evaluateLine(Line){<br>
	If 4  player 1 position in the line<br>
		return Positive Infinity<br>
If 4  player 2 position in the line<br>
		return negative Infinity<br>
	If 3  player 1 position in the line<br>
		Return 100<br>
If 3  player 2 position in the line<br>
	Return -100<br>
If 2  player 1 position in the line, 0 or 1 player 2 position in the line<br>
		Return 10<br>
If 2  player 2 position in the line, 0 or 1 player 1 position in the line<br>
		Return -10<br>

	If 1  player 1 position in the line, 0  player 2 position in the line<br>
		Return 1<br>
	If 1  player 2 position in the line, 0  player 1 position in the line<br>
		Return -1<br>

	Return 0<br>
}<br>

We find all potential 76 line and add up the line evaluation score to form a final board score.

<h2> Sample Results</h2>

<h2> Evaluation and Analysis</h2>
<p>
we notice that the output board provide are very “similar” that is because of this line of code in minimax<br>

if(value>=maxres) {<br>
myNextMove = tem;<br>
	maxres = value;<br>
}<br>
That means that we always choose the last MAX value;<br>
In order to make our code more “Human” We introduce random. If two value are the same, there are 50 percent chance that we choose the next max value<br>
	if(value>maxres) {<br>
		myNextMove = tem;<br>
		maxres = value;<br>
		}<br>
	if(value==maxres) {<br>
		Random rand = new Random();<br>
		int x = rand.nextInt(2);<br>
		if(x==1) {<br>
		myNextMove = tem;<br>
		maxres = value;<br>
		}<br>
	}<br>
This is the AI vs AI board after random
<img src = "Randomness.png">

Time Used:<br>
Before Alpha-beta pruning, The AI vs random game takes 3 min to finish.After Alpha-beta pruning, The AI vs random game takes 30s finish.
This is because Alpha-beta pruning greatly decrease the calculation and make our program much efficient.



After the code updated, the win rate of player 1 decrease from 76 to 55.

<h2> Conclusions</h2>
<p>We believe that it is fairly easy to implement a AI system that defeat a random AI player. However, it is hard to make a AI system more organicaly, more human.  </p>
